## Workflow Engine

### Standard Workflow States
```
New → Assigned → In Progress → Pending → Resolved → Closed
```

### Custom Workflows
Administrators can create custom workflows for specific ticket types:

```typescript
// Example workflow configuration
const workflowConfig = {
  type: "change",
  states: ["submitted", "reviewed", "approved", "scheduled", "implemented", "verified"],
  rules: [
    {
      condition: "priority === 'critical'",
      action: "skip_normal_approval"
    }
  ]
};
```

### Example SLA Configuration
```json
{
  "policy_name": "Standard IT Support",
  "priority_matrix": {
    "critical": {
      "response_time": "1 hour",
      "resolution_time": "4 hours"
    },
    "high": {
      "response_time": "2 hours",
      "resolution_time": "8 hours"
    },
    "medium": {
      "response_time": "4 hours",
      "resolution_time": "24 hours"
    },
    "low": {

# Check SLA compliance
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer <token>" \
     "http://0.0.0.0:5000/api/analytics/sla/compliance"
