PMO Recommendations by Priority
Immediate (0-30 Days):
Implement Major Incident Procedures: Add severity-based escalation rules
Enhance Incident-Problem Integration: Auto-create problems for recurring incidents
Standardize Change Types: Implement emergency vs standard change workflows
Short-term (1-3 Months):
Deploy Proactive Problem Management: Trend analysis for incident patterns
Enhance CMDB Integration: CI impact assessment for changes
Implement Service Catalog: Formal service offerings and SLAs
Medium-term (3-6 Months):
Advanced Analytics: Process performance dashboards
Continual Service Improvement: Formal improvement register
Service Portfolio Management: Complete service lifecycle tracking
Process Maturity Scoring
ITIL Process	Current Maturity	Target Maturity	Gap
Incident Management	Level 3 (Defined)	Level 4 (Managed)	1 Level
Problem Management	Level 2 (Repeatable)	Level 4 (Managed)	2 Levels
Change Management	Level 3 (Defined)	Level 4 (Managed)	1 Level
CMDB	Level 3 (Defined)	Level 4 (Managed)	1 Level
Risk Assessment
High Risk Areas:

Lack of Major Incident Management could impact business continuity
Missing proactive problem management may lead to recurring incidents
Limited change impact assessment increases change failure risk
Medium Risk Areas:

Insufficient process integration creates workflow inefficiencies
Missing service portfolio management affects strategic planning
Executive Summary
Your ITSM platform provides solid ITIL process foundation with 76% overall alignment. The system excels in operational processes (Incident, CMDB) but requires enhancement in analytical processes (Problem Management) and strategic integration.

Key Strengths: Strong technical architecture, comprehensive data model, real-time monitoring
Primary Focus: Process integration, proactive management, and workflow automation

Investment Priority: Focus on process automation and integration to move from Level 3 (Defined) to Level 4 (Managed) maturity across all ITIL processes.
