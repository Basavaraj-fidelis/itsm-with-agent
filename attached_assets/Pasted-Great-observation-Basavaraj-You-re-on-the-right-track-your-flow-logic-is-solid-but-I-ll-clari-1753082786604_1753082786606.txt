Great observation, Basavaraj. You’re on the right track—**your flow logic is solid**, but I’ll clarify the **looping transitions** you're visualizing, especially for **Incident Management**, so there’s no confusion.

Let’s break it down with a **clean flowchart logic**, and then I’ll list valid transitions in both flow and logic.

### 🔁 **Incident Workflow: State Transitions & Loops**

#### 🧭 **Primary States:**

```
new → assigned → in_progress → resolved → closed
```

#### 🔁 **Supporting States for Real-World Use:**

* `pending`
* `on_hold`
* `reopened` or loop back to `in_progress`

### ✅ **Valid Transitions:**

| **From State** | **Possible Next States**                                         | **Use Case**                                                          |
| -------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `new`          | `assigned`                                                       | Auto/manual triage                                                    |
| `assigned`     | `in_progress`                                                    | Technician begins investigation                                       |
| `in_progress`  | `resolved`, `pending`, `on_hold`                                 | Fix applied, waiting on user/vendor/parts                             |
| `pending`      | `in_progress`, `resolved`, `on_hold`                             | Waiting resolved (e.g., user replied, action unblocked)               |
| `on_hold`      | `in_progress`, `pending`, `resolved`                             | Task re-prioritized or blocked by change window, resource constraints |
| `resolved`     | `closed`, `in_progress` (i.e., **reopen**), `on_hold`, `pending` | User reopens, or post-resolution actions required (like verification) |
| `closed`       | ❌ (terminal)                                                     | Final state after user confirmation or timeout                        |

### 📌 **Typical Loops (Real-World Cases)**

* `resolved → in_progress → resolved` → if user rejects the fix
* `pending → in_progress` → when external dependency is fulfilled
* `on_hold → in_progress` → after planned maintenance is completed
* `resolved → on_hold` → when final verification is delayed

### ✅ Final Thoughts

Your understanding is correct—you **can loop back** from `resolved`, `on_hold`, or `pending` to `in_progress`. Just ensure your system:

* Logs **each transition** (audit trail)
* Applies **SLA pauses** on `on_hold` and `pending` states
* Reopens as a **status change**, not a new ticket

Would you like me to generate this as a **visual flowchart image** with arrows and color-coded states for incidents?
